#  Urban Mobility & Tree Census Mapping (QGIS Projects)

##  Overview
This repository includes two QGIS-based spatial analysis projects focused on New York City:

1. **Network Analysis of Bike Routes**  
2. **Web Map of Refactored Tree Census Data**


##  Project 1: Safest Bike Routes (Network Analysis)

### Methodology
- Created a new shapefile layer: `Bike_Points.shp`
- Plotted 3 custom points across Manhattan
- Used QGIS’s **Shortest Path (Point to Layer)** tool
- Set advanced parameters:
  - Default speed: 50 km/h
  - Start point: manually selected
- Output: calculated optimal paths across NYC’s bike route network

### Output
- Map showing safest rideable paths
- Demonstrates spatial network modeling and urban mobility analysis


## \ Project 2: NYC Tree Census Web Map

### Methodology
- Cleaned and refactored NYC tree census data
- Styled tree points by species and density
- Exported interactive web map using **qgis2web (Leaflet)**
- Focused on Central Park and surrounding neighborhoods

### Output
- Web map with spatial markers, basemap, and tree distribution
- Demonstrates environmental data visualization and urban green-space analysis


##  Skills Demonstrated
- QGIS spatial analysis  
- Network modeling (Shortest Path)  
- Web map creation (qgis2web)  
- Data cleaning and styling  
- Urban planning and environmental interpretation
