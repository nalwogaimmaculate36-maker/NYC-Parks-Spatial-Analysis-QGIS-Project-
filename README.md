# 🌿 NYC Parks Spatial Analysis (QGIS Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores New York City’s park system using QGIS, with a focused spatial analysis of **Central Park**. The goal was to integrate multiple public datasets, visualize spatial relationships, and demonstrate applied GIS skills relevant to MEL, data analysis, and urban planning.

The project includes:
- Multi-layer spatial mapping
- CRS management
- Symbology and labeling
- Spatial interpretation of NYC’s green spaces

## 🗂️ Data Sources
All datasets were sourced from NYC Open Data, including:
- NYC Parks shapefile
- Central Park polygon layer
- NYC bike routes
- NYC tree census
- NYC wildlife observations


## 🧹 Data Preparation (QGIS Workflow)
- Imported all layers and standardized them to a common CRS (EPSG:2263)
- Cleaned attribute tables and removed unnecessary fields
- Styled layers using custom symbology for clarity
- Applied labeling rules for parks and major features
- Created a multi-layer map layout for export



## 🧩 Layers Included
- **Parks Layer:** All NYC parks with Central Park highlighted
- **Bike Routes:** Cycling paths intersecting or surrounding park areas
- **Tree Census:** Tree distribution across NYC
- **Wildlife Observations:** Species presence within and around Central Park
- **Basemap:** OpenStreetMap for geographic context

---

## 🗺️ Map Output
The final map visualizes:
- Central Park as the primary study area
- Spatial relationships between parks, mobility routes, and environmental assets
- Distribution patterns of trees and wildlife




## 🎯 Key Insights
- Central Park sits at the intersection of major mobility routes
- Tree density varies significantly across park boundaries
- Wildlife observations cluster around water bodies and forested areas
- The park acts as a major ecological anchor within Manhattan



## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- QGIS spatial analysis
- Layer styling and symbology
- CRS management
- Map layout design
- Urban environmental interpretation
